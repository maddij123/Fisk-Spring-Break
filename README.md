**Summary:
The "Fisk Student Spring Break Vacation Planner Proposal" is a web-based application designed to help users plan their vacation at some of the top Spring Break locations. The application provides tools for creating customized itineraries, discovering points of interest, finding accommodations, and optimizing transportation options.

**Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly and comprehensive web application that assists travelers in planning memorable road trips and vacations across the United States. The application aims to streamline the trip-planning process, enhance the travel experience, and provide users with valuable resources and recommendations for their journeys. By offering tools for creating customized itineraries, discovering points of interest, finding accommodations, optimizing transportation, and tracking expenses, the application seeks to empower users to plan and enjoy their Spring Break vacations to the fullest.

**Technical Implementation:
The web application will be developed in two versions:

One version will be built using Flask-MySQL, where the data is stored and managed using a MySQL database.
The second version will be developed using Flask-MongoDB, leveraging MongoDB for data storage.

Both versions of the application will maintain the same functionality and user experience, allowing for a comparison of how each database handles the data and operations.
